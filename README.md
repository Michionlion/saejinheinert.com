## Developing

To build a live, developer version of the website, simply use
`./build.sh serve`. To build the website (into the `$PROJECT/dist` directory
by default) use `hugo`.

If you've changed the javascript or scss, use `./build.sh`. You can also run
`./build.sh js` or `./build.sh css` to build only the relevent files.
