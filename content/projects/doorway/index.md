title: "Doorway"
---

Doorway was an art project completed for ART385 at Allegheny College. The aim
of the piece is to evoke a sensation of mysterious curiosity, but also fear ---
similar to the feeling that the chimpanzees probably felt during the opening of
*2001: A Space Odyssey*. *2001*'s monolith was also an inspiration for the look
of the portal itself.
