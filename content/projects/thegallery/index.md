*Gallery* is a site-specific virtual reality experience shown during *Free Wine: Art + Food* at the Allegheny Art Gallery. It explores the concept of Worlding, a way of looking at wholes, systems, cultures, or networks that accounts for emergence and the experience of being in something. It talks of creating Worlds, but also bringing them closer, making them personal, and visualizing them. In this virtual reality experience, the gallery around you will become something more. Exploration and attention are key because if you blink and don’t look around, you just might miss an entire existence.

The following paragraphs are a description of the inspirations and context surrounding *Gallery*. However, in virtual reality art and especially this work, experiencing it is paramount. Therefore, I would encourage viewers to enter and experience *Gallery* first if they are able, and read about it second. Ultimately the experience is the only meaningful art production, and so the viewer's experience must be the defining source for meaning and interpretation. Although it is not the same, experiencing *Gallery* off-site is possible -- see the download links above!

The key contextualization for *Gallery* can be found in Ian Cheng’s art, especially *Emissary Forks For You* as displayed at the Migros Museum of Contemporary Art in Zürich, Switzerland. Worlding, a term I was introduced to through Cheng's work, is really the process put on display in *Gallery*. His live-simulations are actual Worldings -- my fleeting portals are views into unseen and unexplored Worldings. Cheng’s use of augmented reality as a viewing experience was also a huge inspiration for *Gallery*.

The primary motivating idea behind *Gallery* came after a lengthy exploration phase in which the technical challenge of photogrammetry, creating 3D computer representations of reality from photographs, was tackled. From this initial exploration, a mixed reality project based on photogrammetry that focused on merging aspects of physical reality with the digital realm emerged. Using highly configurable software such as COLMAP or RealityCapture, detailed models of our complicated world were created from high-quality images. As the project progressed, the idea of merging the digital realm with the physical gradually morphed into the portal interactions and viewing currently present in *Gallery*, through the influence of Ian Cheng.
