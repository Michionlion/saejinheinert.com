[RayTerm](https://github.com/Michionlion/rayterm) is a Comprehensive Senior
Project (also known as a bachelor's thesis) developed while I was at Allegheny
College. It is a path-tracing library that enables real-time graphics in the
terminal.

### Abstract

Over the many years of innovation in the field of computer graphics, advances
in rendering have led to massive increases in the fidelity of engaging,
satisfying, and realistic computer visualizations.  RayTerm is a new and unique
entry into the ranks of rendering engines, and makes its own contributions to
the field of computer graphics.  While harkening back to the retro aesthetics
of the seventies and eighties, RayTerm embraces new advances in computing power
to bring path-traced photorealistic visuals to an old screen --- the terminal.
Using Unicode block characters to simulate pixels and a single-branch
path-tracer written in C++ and CUDA, RayTerm renders a fully three-dimensional
scene, complete with global illumination and physically-based materials.
RayTerm can be used as an engine for terminal-based tools, visualizations,
games, and more; it is fully open-source and ready for integration or use
within other projects.

The full thesis document is [available]({{< ref "thesis.md" >}}),
and the open-source implementation repository is available on
[GitHub](https://github.com/Michionlion/rayterm).
