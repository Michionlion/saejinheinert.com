## A Ray-Tracing Rendering Engine for XTerm-like Terminals

Currently at the proposal stage, RayTerm is a Comprehensive Senior Project (also known as a bachelor's thesis) at Allegheny College. It proposes a rendering engine using ray-tracing that displays real-time graphics in the terminal. This is accomplished through Unicode character graphics.

The proposal is available [here](https://saejinmh.com/rayterm_proposal.pdf), and the open-source implementation repository is available on [Github](https://github.com/Michionlion/rayterm).
